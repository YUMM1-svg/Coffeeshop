        <p>
          Founded in 2020, Bean & Bean began as a small neighborhood cafÃ© with a big dream â€” 
          to bring people together over great coffee. Every bean we brew is locally sourced, 
          freshly roasted, and brewed with love. Whether youâ€™re working, studying, or simply 
          catching up with friends, weâ€™re here to make every sip special.
